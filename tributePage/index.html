        <ul>
          <li>Born, raised, and educated in Switzerland.</li>
          <li>First worked as a professor in the  Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences whilst being a medic in the Russian Navy.</li>
          <li>Next worked as a professor in the Berlin Academy, where he accomplished much of his life's works and discoveries.</li>
          <li>Returned to working with the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences near the end of his life.</li>
          <li>Best known for his enormous contributions to mathematics and physics.</li>
          <li>His works and discoveries also greatly influenced astronomy, engineering, and music.</li>
          <li>He worked on so many topics that he is usually the earliest written reference for most of them.</li>
          <li>To avoid confusion, many of the discoveries and theorems attributed to Euler were named to the next person who proved them, <em>after Euler</em>.</li>
