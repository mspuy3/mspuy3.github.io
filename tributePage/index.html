        <h2>A glimpse on Euler's life.</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Leonhard Euler was born, raised, and educated in Switzerland.</li>
          <li>He first worked as a professor in the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences while being a medic in the Russian Navy.</li>
          <li>Euler next worked as a professor in the Berlin Academy, where he accomplished much of his life's works and discoveries.</li>
          <li>Later in life, he returned to work with the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences until he died in 1783.</li>
          <li>He is best known for his enormous contributions to mathematics and physics.</li>
          <li>His works and discoveries also greatly influenced astronomy, engineering, and music.</li>
          <li>He worked on so many topics that he is usually the best, earliest written reference for most of them.</li>
          <li>Many of the discoveries and theorems first credited to Euler were instead named to the person who next proved them, to avoid confusion in having many concepts named after Euler (<a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://everything.explained.today/List_of_things_named_after_Leonhard_Euler/">see them here</a>).</li>
        </ul>
